DESCRIPTION				       *repeatableMapping-description*

RETROFIT MAPPING REPETITION						    * 
Some plugins provide out-of-the-box support for repeat.vim, many do not.
Some mappings have been developed in an ad-hoc fashion, e.g. as custom
filetype-specific workflow shortcuts, and therefore do not have the
canonical remapping layer of <Plug> mappings (which repeat.vim requires). 

This plugin allows to retrofit repeatability to mappings from plugins that
do not directly use repeat.vim. It also offers a succinct way for custom
mappings to acquire repeatability, and spares them the definition of
<Plug>-mappings and adding the repeat#set() boilerplate code themselves. 

VISUAL MODE REPETITION							    * 
repeat.vim only supports normal mode repetition, as this is the only
repetition that is built into Vim. However, one can define repetition in
visual mode: >
    xnoremap . :normal .<CR>
(Or better a more fancy version that only applies the repeat command over
entire lines in linewise visual mode, keeps the current cursor position in
characterwise visual mode, and does nothing (sensible) in blockwise visual
mode.) 

The <Plug>ReenterVisualMode mapping allows to apply repeat.vim repetition to
visual mode commands; just prepend it in the call to repeat#set(): >
    vnoremap <silent> <Plug>MyMapping ...:silent! call repeat#set("\<Plug>ReenterVisualMode\<Plug>MyMapping")<CR>

If a visual mode mapping is repeated from an active visual selection, that
selection is the affected area for the repetition. If repetition is invoked
in normal mode, the repetition works on a new selection starting at the
cursor position, with the same size as the last visual selection (times
[count]). 
If a non-visual mode mapping is repeated from an active visual selection, it
won't (can't) apply to the visual selection, but to whatever that mapping
typically applies. So, you can only repeat previous visual mode mappings on
a visual selection! The only way around this is to cross-link both mapping
types, and to use an even more intelligent version of the repeat definition
in visual mode. 

Through visualrepeat.vim, it is possible to make normal mode and visual mode
mappings repeat each other, with the normal mode mapping through the visual
mode mapping repeated over the visual selection, and the visual mode mapping
repeated over a new selection starting at the cursor position, with the same
size as the last visual selection (times [count]). 
For this, use the repeatableMapping#makeCrossRepeatable() function.

USAGE						     *repeatableMapping-usage*

First define your mapping in the usual way:
    nnoremap <silent> <Leader>v :version<CR>
Then make the mapping repeatable; this will redefine the original mapping
and insert the call to repeat#set() at the end. >
    silent! call repeatableMapping#makeRepeatable('nnoremap', '<Leader>v', 'Test2')
The processing requires the following information:
- The original mapping command (for the map-mode, whether "noremap" or not,
  any optional map-arguments like "<buffer>"; "<silent>" is added
  automatically to avoid showing the repeat invocation). 
- The mapping's lhs (i.e. keys that invoke the mapping). 
- A unique name for the intermediate <Plug> mapping that needs to be created
  so that repeat.vim can invoke it. 
- Optional: The default count that will be prefixed to the mapping if no
  explicit numeric argument was given; i.e. the second optional argument of
  repeat#set(). If your mapping doesn't accept a numeric argument and you
  never want to receive one, pass a value of -1.

If you already have a <Plug> mapping: >
    vnoremap <silent> <Plug>ShowVersion :<C-U>version<CR>
    vmap <Leader>v <Plug>ShowVersion
You can redefine the <Plug> mapping directly, and just have the call to
repeat#set() appended: >
    silent! call repeatableMapping#makeRepeatable('vnoremap', '<Plug>ShowVersion')
This is especially useful to retrofit existing visual mode mappings with the
ability to be repeatable, in conjunction with the visual mode repetition
described above.

INSTALLATION				      *repeatableMapping-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim repeatableMapping.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command. 

DEPENDENCIES				      *repeatableMapping-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. 

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				     *repeatableMapping-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|: 

						*g:repeatableMapping_MyOption*
To change the default TODO from FOO to BAR, use: >
    let g:repeatableMapping_MyOption = 'BAR'
